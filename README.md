# OpenHiven.py Documentation

## Deploying and testing docs

To deploy the docs simply use the python module `mike`, which is used for 
versioning. The following snippet will run a simple http server and update
the docs when changed:

```bash
mike serve
```

*Note! Install `openhiven.py` locally for the autodoc extension to work*
